As AI becomes more prominent in marketing, ethical considerations and data privacy are gaining importance. Marketers must prioritize ethical practices and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Furthermore, AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable to maintain trust with customers.

Continuous Learning and Adaptation
